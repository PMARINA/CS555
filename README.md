## About

This project will involve analyzing GEDCOM files. [Wikipedia Page on GEDCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM).

## Developer Guidelines

* We'll be using Python & MongoDB for this project. Please familiarize yourself with both and install the following, preferably in this order:
  * MongoDB
  * MongoDB Compass (for easy viewing of the database)
  * Python 3.8 (not sure if necessary)
  * Anaconda (for environment/dependency management)
* Clone this repository
* `conda env create -f environment.yml`
  * If a new package is installed (prefer conda over pip):
    * `conda env export > environment.yml`
    * `conda deactivate`
    * `conda env remove -n CS555`
    * `conda env create -f environment.yml`
    * `conda activate CS555`
      * You will need to run this every time you open a new terminal
    * `conda develop gedutil`
      * This only needs to be run any time you create/re-create the environment
* `pre-commit install`
  * You will have to run this every time you clone the repo somewhere new

### Implementing a new user story

* Please create a branch off of `main` and name it `USXX`. Follow the structure from US01 unless we decide to refactor, as a team
* After completing testing, please submit a pull request and wait for all other team members to approve it before merging it back into main. All testcases must pass. If they don't, we will rebase back to the last working commit and the pull request will have to be re-requested.
* The person submitting the pull request should complete the merge after everyone has marked it as approved
* The merge strategy will be merge, and not rebase.

### How to test

* `conda activate CS555`
* `pytest`

## Commit Guidelines

We will be using commit messages of the following format:

```text
[TYPE] Header line

- Body bullet
- More body [oh look](https://example.com) - A link!
- Another bullet

You can also just write paragraphs...
```

For convenience, I won't be enforcing commit message guidelines using precommit scripts, but please follow carefully.

Types:

* [BUILD] - a build commit
* [BUG] - a bugfix
* [MERGE] - a merge commit. You can also just use the standard commit message that's autogenerated during merges
* [REFACTOR] - a commit for refactoring code.
* [MISC] - any commit that doesn't fall under the existing guidelines. Shouldn't be used often.

Please use commits as intended (just one change/commit). If you find yourself building something, fixing a bug, and refactoring all in one commit, stop and commit each change separately.
